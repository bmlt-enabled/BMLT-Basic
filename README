DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT) is a powerful, database-driven system for tracking NA meetings.
It is NOT an official product of NA ( http://na.org ). Rather, it is a project designed and implemented by
NA members, and meant to be used by official NA Service bodies.

This project implements a "standalone satellite." It does not have to be integrated into a content management
system.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The project requires a functioning BMLT root server ( http://bmlt.magshare.net/root-server ).
It does not implement a root server, but connects to an existing one.
It requires a Web server capable of executing PHP 5.0 or above.

This class uses the BMLT Satellite Base Class, which is available on GitHub, here:

    https://github.com/MAGSHARE/BMLT-Satellite-Base-Class
    

INSTALLATION
------------

You need to move the "bmlt-basic" directory, and all its contents, into a PHP-executable directory
that is the same level as the file that will include it.

You need to have the config-bmlt-basic.inc.php in the same directory. This is the file that will
be modified to establish the settings.

i.e.:

    <html>---
            |
            V
            <bmlt-basic>-----------------
            |                           |
            |                           V
            V                           bmlt_basic.class.php
            config-bmlt-basic.inc.php           *
            |                                   *
            |                                  etc.
            V
            index.php
            
            
Below, is a super-simple implementation of the BMLT:

<?php require_once ( dirname ( __FILE__ ).'/bmlt-basic/bmlt_basic.class.php' ); ?>
<head><?php $basic_bmlt_object->output_head(); ?></head>
<body><?php $basic_bmlt_object->output_body(); ?></body>
